Answers to assignment 5
#1.Installation of VS Code:

I download Visual Studio Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
I run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
No specific prerequisites are needed other than having a compatible version of Windows 11.

#2. First-time Setup:

I adjust settings like theme, font size, and keybindings in the Settings view.
I install essential extensions for my workflow, such as "Python" for Python development or "ESLint" for JavaScript linting.

#3.User Interface Overview:

The Activity Bar provides access to different views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.
The Side Bar contains the Explorer, Search, Git, and other views.
The Editor Group displays open files or editors.
The Status Bar shows information about the current file, Git status, and other notifications.

#4.Command Palette:

I access the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.
Examples of tasks I perform using the Command Palette include opening files (Open File), searching for commands (Search for Command), and installing extensions (Extensions: Install Extensions).
Extensions in VS Code:

#5.Extensions enhance VS Code's functionality.

I find, install, and manage extensions through the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Examples of essential extensions for me include "Debugger for Chrome" for debugging JavaScript in Chrome, "Live Server" for live web development, and "GitLens" for enhanced Git functionalities.

#6. Integrated Terminal:

I open the integrated terminal with Ctrl+.
Advantages include running commands and scripts without leaving the editor, interacting with the debugger, and managing Git operations.

#7. File and Folder Management:

I create, open, and manage files and folders using the Explorer view (Ctrl+Shift+E).
I navigate between files and directories efficiently using shortcuts like Ctrl+P to open a file by name.

#8.Settings and Preferences:

I find and customize settings in the Settings view (Ctrl+,).
Examples of changes I make include changing the theme (workbench.colorTheme), font size (editor.fontSize), and keybindings (keybindings.json).

#9. Debugging in VS Code:

I set up debugging by creating a launch configuration in the launch.json file and adding breakpoints to the code.
Features I use include stepping through code, inspecting variables, and using the debugger console.
#10. Using Source Control:

I integrate Git with VS Code by initializing a repository (git init), staging changes (git add), committing (git commit -m "message"), and pushing changes to GitHub.
